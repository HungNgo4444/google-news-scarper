# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Google News Scraper**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Analysis Result:** This is a **brownfield enhancement project** based on an existing, well-established Google News Scraper backend system.

**Current Project State:**
- **Backend:** Fully functional FastAPI-based REST API system
- **Technology Stack:** FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis + Celery + Docker
- **Architecture:** Microservices with containerized deployment
- **API Endpoints:** Complete CRUD operations for categories (`/api/v1/categories`)
- **Task System:** Celery-based crawling engine with scheduler
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with proper migrations using Alembic
- **Infrastructure:** Docker Compose with service orchestration

**Enhancement Scope:** Adding a new web interface (frontend) using Node.js + TailwindCSS + Shadcn UI to provide a user-friendly alternative to the current Swagger UI for managing categories, triggering crawl jobs, and viewing articles.

**Architectural Constraints:**
- **Must preserve:** All existing backend API endpoints and functionality
- **Must coexist:** With current Docker containerized deployment
- **Must integrate:** With existing Celery task system and PostgreSQL database
- **Cannot modify:** Core backend architecture or database schema
