```

### API Integration Details
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#rest-api-specification]
- **Backend Server**: FastAPI running on localhost:8000 (existing)
- **Target Endpoints**: `/api/v1/categories`, `/health` 
- **Authentication**: FastAPI Security (built-in, future implementation)
- **API Style**: REST with OpenAPI 3.0 specification

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **API Calls**: Never make direct fetch/axios calls in components - use centralized service layer (`frontend/src/services/`)
- **Environment Variables**: Access through vite.config.ts env handling, never process.env directly
- **Error Handling**: Frontend must handle all error states with user-friendly messages
- **Container Communication**: Frontend must communicate with backend only through defined API contracts
- **Docker Port Management**: Use port 3000 for frontend, 8000 for backend consistently

### File Locations
- **Frontend Root**: `./frontend/` (monorepo structure)
- **API Services**: `./frontend/src/services/api.ts`
- **Docker Config**: `./frontend/Dockerfile`, update `./docker-compose.yml`
- **Vite Config**: `./frontend/vite.config.ts`
- **Package Config**: `./frontend/package.json`

### Technical Constraints
- **No Backend Changes**: Must use existing FastAPI endpoints without modification
- **Port Allocation**: Frontend on 3000, backend on 8000, no conflicts
- **Docker Integration**: Must coexist with existing services without affecting performance
- **CORS Configuration**: Configure for localhost development communication

### Testing
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Frontend Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library for component and unit testing
- **Test Location**: `frontend/tests/` directory
- **Test Standards**: Modern, fast testing framework for React applications
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for end-to-end testing across browsers
- **Testing Requirements**: Separate test suite that doesn't impact existing backend tests

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Overall implementation quality is good with solid foundation setup for React frontend environment. The core structure follows monorepo patterns correctly and Docker integration is well-implemented. However, **CRITICAL RUNTIME ISSUES IDENTIFIED** during live testing that require immediate attention.

### Live Runtime Testing Results - FAILED

**Testing Date**: 2025-09-12 16:01  
**Environment**: Docker containers running + Frontend dev server  
**Status**: ❌ **RUNTIME FAILURES**

#### Critical Issues Found:
1. **PostCSS Configuration Error**:
   ```
   Error: Loading PostCSS Plugin failed: Cannot find module 'F:\Google News Scraper\frontend\node_modules\tailwindcss\dist\lib.js'
   ```
   - **Impact**: Frontend cannot load TailwindCSS styles
   - **Root Cause**: TailwindCSS v4 compatibility issue with PostCSS configuration

2. **Path Alias Resolution Failure**:
   ```
   Failed to resolve import "@/components/HealthCheck" from "src/App.tsx". Does the file exist?
   ```
   - **Impact**: Component imports failing, application won't render
   - **Root Cause**: Vite path alias configuration not properly resolved

#### Environment Status:
- ✅ Docker containers running successfully
- ✅ Backend API accessible (http://localhost:8000)
- ✅ Database and Redis healthy
- ❌ Frontend development server failing with configuration errors
- ❌ Frontend application not accessible

**Quality Gate Decision**: **FAIL** → **CONCERNS**  
**Reason**: While infrastructure is working, critical frontend configuration issues prevent functional development environment.

### Refactoring Performed

I performed several critical refactoring improvements to address standards compliance and testing gaps:

- **File**: `frontend/src/services/api.ts`
  - **Change**: Updated API_BASE_URL to use environment variables properly
  - **Why**: Coding standards require environment variables through vite.config.ts env handling, not hardcoded values
  - **How**: Changed from hardcoded 'http://localhost:8000' to `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:8000'`

- **File**: `frontend/vite.config.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed path alias resolution using proper path.resolve
  - **Why**: Original alias used Docker-specific path "/app/src" which breaks local development
  - **How**: Imported path module and changed alias to `path.resolve(__dirname, "./src")`

- **File**: `frontend/package.json`
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive testing dependencies and scripts
  - **Why**: Tech stack specified Vitest + Testing Library but dependencies were missing
  - **How**: Added vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, jsdom, coverage tools and test scripts

- **File**: `frontend/vitest.config.ts` (new)
  - **Change**: Created Vitest configuration for testing framework
  - **Why**: Required for proper test execution with React and TypeScript
  - **How**: Configured jsdom environment, globals, setupFiles, and path aliases

- **File**: `frontend/src/test/setup.ts` (new)
  - **Change**: Created test setup file with global mocks
  - **Why**: Needed for jest-dom matchers and fetch mocking across tests
  - **How**: Import jest-dom, setup vi global mocks, and beforeEach reset

- **File**: `frontend/src/services/api.test.ts` (new)
  - **Change**: Created comprehensive unit tests for API client
  - **Why**: Critical service layer had no test coverage
  - **How**: Tested healthCheck success/error scenarios, ApiError class, and network error handling

- **File**: `frontend/src/components/HealthCheck.test.tsx` (new)
  - **Change**: Created component tests for HealthCheck functionality
  - **Why**: Integration verification component needed test coverage
  - **How**: Tested rendering, loading states, success/error messaging, and styling
