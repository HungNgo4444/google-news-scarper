# Story 2.6: Parallel Pipeline Processing Implementation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator managing high-volume Google News crawling operations,
**I want** the crawler to process URL resolution, article extraction, and database saving in parallel pipelines,
**so that** crawling throughput increases by 3x and articles are saved immediately as they're extracted instead of waiting for entire job completion.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. URL resolution, article extraction, and database saving run in parallel stages
2. Articles are saved to database immediately after extraction (not batch at job end)
3. Each stage processes items independently with queue-based communication
4. System achieves 3x throughput improvement over current sequential processing
   - **Baseline**: Current sequential: ~30 articles/minute (Story 2.5 measurements)
   - **Target**: Parallel pipeline: ~90 articles/minute (3x improvement)
   - **Measurement**: Total articles saved / total execution time
   - **Success Criteria**: >= 85 articles/minute (2.8x minimum acceptable)
5. Failed stages don't crash other stages (fault isolation)
6. Memory usage remains under 2GB per worker process
7. Real-time progress tracking shows articles saved during job execution
8. Queue backpressure prevents memory overflow when producer > consumer
9. Database connection pooling handles concurrent write operations
10. Pipeline supports configurable worker counts per stage (2-10 workers each)
11. Error recovery with dead letter queues for failed items
12. Comprehensive monitoring for queue depths and processing rates

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Based on current system architecture [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md], the parallel pipeline will be implemented in the crawler engine layer (`src/core/crawler/`) with integration points to the task scheduling system (`src/core/scheduler/tasks.py`).

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.5 completion, the system now supports:
- Enhanced worker queue configuration with multiple queue types
- Increased URL processing limits (100 URLs vs previous 15)
- Improved browser tab management (20 tabs vs previous 10)
- Validated concurrent job execution (8-12 jobs simultaneously)

### Current Sequential Workflow Analysis
Current implementation in `src/core/crawler/sync_engine.py`:
1. Google News Search → URLs found
2. URL Resolution → Resolve all Google URLs to article URLs (batch of 10 URLs/browser)
3. Article Extraction → Extract all articles (batch of 5 threads)
4. Database Save → Save all articles at job completion

**Bottleneck**: Sequential processing where each stage waits for previous stage completion.

### Technical Implementation Details

**Queue Architecture Design:**
```python
# Pipeline queues for stage communication
url_queue = Queue(maxsize=1000)          # Raw Google URLs
resolved_queue = Queue(maxsize=1000)     # Resolved article URLs
extracted_queue = Queue(maxsize=500)     # Extracted article data
save_queue = Queue(maxsize=100)          # Ready for database
```

**Worker Configuration:**
- URL Resolvers: 2-3 Playwright browsers running concurrently
- Article Extractors: 3-4 newspaper4k worker threads
- Database Savers: 1-2 batch save workers with connection pooling

**File Locations for Implementation:**
- New pipeline service: `src/core/crawler/parallel_pipeline.py`
- Enhanced crawler: `src/core/crawler/sync_engine.py` (modify `crawl_category_sync()`)
- Repository enhancement: `src/database/repositories/sync_article_repo.py`
- Progress tracking: `src/database/repositories/sync_job_repo.py`
- Configuration: `src/shared/config.py` (add pipeline settings)

**Database Schema Updates:**

**Migration File:** `src/database/migrations/versions/003_add_pipeline_optimization.py`

def upgrade():
    """Optimize for concurrent writes (no progress_percentage column needed)."""

    # Optimize article table for concurrent inserts
    # Add composite index for job_id + created_at (used in job-to-articles queries)
    op.create_index(

    #

def downgrade():
    """Remove optimization indexes."""
    op.drop_index('idx_articles_job_created_concurrent', table_name='articles')
```

**Database Connection Pool Configuration:**
```python
# src/database/connection.py - Update for concurrent writes

# Increase connection pool size for concurrent save workers
engine = create_async_engine(
    DATABASE_URL,
    pool_size=10,          # Increased from 5 (2 save workers + overhead)
    max_overflow=5,        # Additional connections during peak load
    pool_pre_ping=True,    # Verify connections before use
    pool_recycle=3600,     # Recycle connections every hour
    echo=False
)
```

### Testing Standards

**Integration Testing Requirements:**
```python
# Test files location: tests/integration/
# Framework: pytest with testcontainers for real services

def test_parallel_pipeline_fault_isolation():
    """Test that one stage failure doesn't crash other stages"""

def test_concurrent_database_saves():
    """Test data integrity with multiple concurrent saves"""

def test_queue_backpressure_handling():
    """Test memory limits with queue size restrictions"""
```

**Performance Testing Requirements:**
- Load test with 1000+ URLs to validate 3x throughput improvement
- Memory usage monitoring under concurrent processing
- Database connection pool testing with concurrent writes
- Queue depth monitoring and backpressure validation

**Technology Stack:**
- Threading: ThreadPoolExecutor for URL resolution workers [Source: tech-stack.md]
- Async Processing: newspaper4k built-in threading for article extraction
- Database: PostgreSQL with connection pooling [Source: tech-stack.md]
- Queue Management: Python Queue with maxsize limits
- Monitoring: Python structlog for performance metrics [Source: tech-stack.md]

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

**High Risk Areas:**
1. **Concurrency Issues**: Implement thread-safe operations and comprehensive testing
2. **Memory Management**: Add queue size limits and cleanup procedures
3. **Database Contention**: Use connection pooling and transaction optimization

**Configuration Strategy:**
```yaml
# Environment variables for pipeline tuning
PIPELINE_URL_WORKERS=2
PIPELINE_EXTRACT_WORKERS=3
PIPELINE_SAVE_WORKERS=1
PIPELINE_QUEUE_SIZE=1000
PIPELINE_BATCH_SIZE=10
```

### Business Flow Clarifications

**Technical Review Date:** 2025-10-01
**Reviewed By:** Dev Agent (James)
**Status:** Approved with clarifications

These clarifications resolve ambiguities in the original AC requirements and provide implementation guidance for the dev agent.

#### 1. "Immediate Saving" Definition (AC #2)

**Original AC:** "Articles are saved to database immediately after extraction (not batch at job end)"

**Clarification:**
- **"Immediately" = Micro-batches of 10 articles** (not literal 1-by-1 saving)
- Articles visible in database within seconds of extraction
- Implementation: `save_articles_batch(batch_size=10)` with PostgreSQL `INSERT...ON CONFLICT`

**Rationale:**
- Literal 1-by-1 saving = 100 commits for 100 articles (too slow, violates AC #4 throughput)
- Micro-batches = 10 commits for 100 articles (90% faster, still "immediate" visibility)
- Satisfies "not batch at job end" requirement while maintaining performance

#### 2. Deduplication Strategy (AC #9)

**Challenge:** Concurrent workers may save duplicate URLs simultaneously

**Solution: Database-Level Atomic Deduplication**
```python
# Use PostgreSQL INSERT...ON CONFLICT (atomic, no race conditions)
INSERT INTO articles (url_hash, title, content, crawl_job_id, ...)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ...)
ON CONFLICT (url_hash) DO UPDATE SET
    last_seen = EXCLUDED.last_seen,
    keywords_matched = array_cat(articles.keywords_matched, EXCLUDED.keywords_matched);
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Thread-safe: PostgreSQL handles conflicts atomically via MVCC
- ✅ No application locks needed (Redis locks, advisory locks, etc.)
- ✅ Performance: Single round-trip, no SELECT before INSERT
- ✅ Merge keywords on conflict (preserve existing + new keywords)

**Evidence:** Article model already has `url_hash` UNIQUE constraint (article.py:46-51)

#### 3. Progress Tracking Logic (AC #7)

**Original AC:** "Real-time progress tracking shows articles saved during job execution"

**Challenge:** `articles_found` only known AFTER search completes → progress can't be smooth

**Solution: Multi-Stage Progress Formula**
```python
# Store in existing job_metadata JSONB field (no schema changes)
job_metadata = {
    'total_urls': 100,           # After search_google_news() completes
    'urls_resolved': 85,          # Updated by Stage 1 (URL Resolution)
    'articles_extracted': 72,     # Updated by Stage 2 (Article Extraction)
}
articles_saved = 68  # Existing field, updated by Stage 3 (Database Saving)

# Progress formula (calculated dynamically)
stage1_progress = (urls_resolved / total_urls) * 30.0        # 30% weight
stage2_progress = (articles_extracted / urls_resolved) * 40.0 # 40% weight
stage3_progress = (articles_saved / articles_extracted) * 30.0 # 30% weight
total_progress = stage1_progress + stage2_progress + stage3_progress
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Smooth progress: Updates every few seconds (not just at job end)
- ✅ Stage visibility: Users see which stage is active
- ✅ No schema changes: Uses existing `job_metadata` JSONB + `articles_saved` fields

**Implementation:**
- Update `job_metadata['urls_resolved']` every batch (10 URLs)
- Update `job_metadata['articles_extracted']` every batch (10 articles)
- Update `articles_saved` every database batch save (10 articles)

#### 4. Job Status Transitions (AC #7)

**State Machine:**
```
PENDING (created by scheduler)
    ↓ (Stage 1 starts)
RUNNING (pipeline active, stages processing)
    ↓ (all queues empty + no critical errors)
COMPLETED (normal completion, may have error_message for DLQ items)
    OR
FAILED (critical error, e.g., 0 URLs found from search)
```

**Partial Success Handling:**
- Scenario: 100 URLs found → 80 articles extracted → 50 articles saved → Stage 2 crashes
- **Status:** `COMPLETED` (not `FAILED`)
- **Reason:** 50 articles successfully saved = valid data
- **Error message:** `"Partial completion: Stage 2 failed. 50/80 articles saved."`

**Principles:**
- ✅ Never delete successfully saved articles on pipeline failure
- ✅ Partial success (>0 articles saved) = `COMPLETED` status with error_message
- ✅ Total failure (0 articles saved) = `FAILED` status
- ✅ DLQ items (failed after 3 retries) = logged for investigation, not auto-retried

#### 5. Error Handling & Rollback Behavior

**Transaction-Level Rollback:**
```python
# Database transaction fails (e.g., deadlock) → rollback transaction only
try:
    session.execute(insert_stmt.on_conflict_do_update(...))
    session.commit()
except IntegrityError:
    session.rollback()  # Rollback THIS transaction only
    # Continue processing other batches
```

**NO Job-Level Rollback:**
- ❌ Pipeline fails at 50% → Do NOT delete 50 saved articles
- ✅ Mark job as COMPLETED with error_message
- ✅ Existing constraint allows partial success: `articles_saved <= articles_found`

**Rollback Decision Matrix:**

| **Situation** | **Articles Saved** | **Job Status** | **Action** |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| Pipeline fails at start | 0 | `FAILED` | Normal failure handling |
| Pipeline fails mid-execution | 50 | `COMPLETED` | Keep articles + log error |
| All stages complete | 95 | `COMPLETED` | Normal completion |
| DLQ has items | 89 (6 in DLQ) | `COMPLETED` | Keep 89 + log DLQ items |
| Database deadlock | Varies | `RUNNING` | Retry transaction only |

**Feature Flag Rollback (Production Safety):**
- Set `PIPELINE_ENABLED=false` in .env
- Restart worker containers (< 5 minutes)
- System automatically falls back to sequential `crawl_category_sync()`
- No data loss, no article deletion

#### 6. Queue Overflow Prevention (AC #8)

**Built-in Backpressure:**
```python
# Python Queue.Queue automatic blocking
resolved_queue.put(item, block=True, timeout=60)  # Blocks if queue full

# Queue health monitoring
if resolved_queue.qsize() > 800:  # 80% capacity
    logger.warning("Queue near capacity, backpressure active")
```

**No Manual Intervention Needed:**
- Producer automatically blocks when queue reaches maxsize
- Consumer drains queue at its own pace
- Memory usage stays bounded (maxsize enforced)

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Error rate > 15% (exceeds AC12 target of <10%)
- Memory usage > 2.5GB per worker (exceeds AC6 target of <2GB)
- Throughput < 2x baseline (fails AC4 minimum of 2.8x)
- Queue depth consistently > 1000 items (indicates backpressure failure)
- Database deadlocks or connection pool exhaustion

**Rollback Steps:**
```bash
# Step 1: Disable pipeline via environment variable
echo "PIPELINE_ENABLED=false" >> .env

# Step 2: Restart worker containers to apply change
docker-compose restart worker

# Step 3: Verify fallback to sequential processing
docker logs worker -f  # Should see "Using sequential crawl_category_sync()"

# Step 4: Monitor recovery
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health  # Check system health
```

**Expected Recovery Time:** < 5 minutes
**Data Loss Risk:** None - all processing falls back to proven sequential method

### Graceful Degradation Strategy

**Feature Flag Design:**
```python
# src/core/crawler/sync_engine.py - Automatic fallback

async def crawl_category(self, category: Category):
    """Crawl category with automatic pipeline fallback."""

    # Check feature flag
    if not settings.PIPELINE_ENABLED:
        logger.info("Pipeline disabled, using sequential processing")
        return await self.crawl_category_sync(category)

    try:
        # Attempt parallel pipeline
        logger.info("Using parallel pipeline processing")
        return await self.crawl_category_parallel(category)

    except PipelineException as e:
        # Automatic fallback on pipeline failure
        logger.error(
            "Pipeline failed, falling back to sequential",
            error=str(e),
            correlation_id=self.correlation_id
        )
        return await self.crawl_category_sync(category)
```

**Monitoring Triggers:**
- Pipeline error rate tracked per job execution
- Automatic fallback to sequential if 3 consecutive failures
- Alert sent to monitoring system on fallback activation

### Partial Rollback (Gradual Re-enablement)

**Scenario:** Pipeline has issues but works for some categories

**Strategy:**
```python
# Enable pipeline per-category for gradual rollout

# .env configuration
PIPELINE_ENABLED=true
PIPELINE_ENABLED_CATEGORIES=tech,sports  # Whitelist specific categories

# Code implementation
if settings.PIPELINE_ENABLED and category.slug in settings.PIPELINE_ENABLED_CATEGORIES:
    return await self.crawl_category_parallel(category)
else:
    return await self.crawl_category_sync(category)
```

### Database Migration Rollback

**Scenario:** Need to rollback database changes

```bash
# Rollback Alembic migration
docker exec -it backend alembic downgrade -1

# This will:
# - Drop progress_percentage column
# - Drop optimization indexes
# - Restore previous schema
```

**Safety:** Migration is non-destructive - only adds columns and indexes
**Downgrade Time:** < 30 seconds
**Risk:** Low - existing data unchanged

### Performance Tuning (Alternative to Full Rollback)

**Scenario:** Pipeline works but not meeting performance targets

**Tuning Options:**
```bash
# Option 1: Reduce worker counts (lower memory usage)
PIPELINE_URL_WORKERS=1      # Down from 2
PIPELINE_EXTRACT_WORKERS=2  # Down from 3
PIPELINE_SAVE_WORKERS=1     # Keep same

# Option 2: Reduce queue sizes (lower memory footprint)
PIPELINE_QUEUE_SIZE=500     # Down from 1000

# Option 3: Reduce batch size (smoother processing)
PIPELINE_BATCH_SIZE=5       # Down from 10

# Apply changes
docker-compose restart worker
```

### Rollback Decision Matrix

| Metric | Threshold | Action | Rollback Type |
|--------|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Error Rate | > 15% | Immediate disable | Full rollback |
| Memory Usage | > 2.5GB | Tune workers down | Partial rollback |
| Throughput | < 2x (60 articles/min) | Tune config | Performance tuning |
| Queue Depth | > 1000 sustained | Reduce batch size | Configuration change |
| Database Deadlocks | > 5 per hour | Disable pipeline | Immediate rollback |
| CPU Usage | > 90% sustained | Reduce workers | Performance tuning |

### Post-Rollback Actions

**Immediate (< 1 hour):**
1. ✅ Verify sequential processing working normally
2. ✅ Check error logs for root cause analysis
3. ✅ Notify stakeholders of rollback and timeline
4. ✅ Document failure scenario for future prevention

**Short-term (1-3 days):**
1. 🔍 Analyze production logs and metrics
2. 🔍 Reproduce issue in staging environment
3. 🔍 Implement fix based on root cause
4. 🔍 Test fix thoroughly before re-deployment

**Long-term (1-2 weeks):**
1. 📊 Create additional monitoring for failure scenario
2. 📊 Add integration test covering the failure case
3. 📊 Update documentation with lessons learned
4. 📊 Plan gradual re-enablement strategy

### Communication Plan

**Stakeholder Notification Template:**
```
