# Story 2.1: Enhanced Jobs Management with Article Viewing

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Ready for QA Review

## Story

**As an** Admin/Developer,
**I want** to view articles crawled by specific jobs and manage job priorities,
**so that** I can immediately inspect crawl results and prioritize urgent crawling tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Job Actions Enhancement**: Add "Run Now", "Edit", "Delete" buttons to each job in JobsList
2. **Article Viewing Integration**: "View Articles" button opens modal/tab showing articles found by that specific job
3. **Article Metadata Display**: Show URL, title, publish_date, content preview, matched keywords for each article
4. **Job Priority Management**: "Run Now" sets job to high priority, bypassing normal queue order
5. **Job Configuration Editing**: Modal for editing job settings (priority, retry_count, metadata)
6. **Job Deletion with Confirmation**: Confirmation dialog showing impact before job deletion
7. **Data Export from Article View**: In the "View Articles" interface, an "Export Data" button must be present. Upon clicking, the user must be prompted to choose an export format from **JSON**, **Excel (.xlsx)**, and **CSV**. All exported files must be encoded in **UTF-8** to ensure full support for Vietnamese characters.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the first implementation story building on the completed foundation.

### Data Models [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**CrawlJob Model:**
```typescript
interface CrawlJob {
  id: string;
  category_id: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  celery_task_id?: string;
  started_at?: string;
  completed_at?: string;
  articles_found: number;
  articles_saved: number;
  error_message?: string;
  retry_count: number;
  priority: number;
  job_metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  correlation_id?: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

**Article Model:**
```typescript
interface Article {
  id: string;
  url: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  summary?: string;
  publish_date: string;
  author?: string;
  image_url?: string;
  keywords_matched: string[];
  relevance_score: number;
  crawl_job_id?: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### API Specifications [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

**Articles API:**
- GET `/api/v1/articles?job_id={id}&page=1&size=20` - List articles by job
- GET `/api/v1/articles/{id}` - Get article details
- POST `/api/v1/articles/export` - Export articles in JSON/CSV/Excel

**Jobs API Enhancements:**
- PATCH `/api/v1/jobs/{id}/priority` - Update job priority (Run Now)
- PUT `/api/v1/jobs/{id}` - Update job configuration
- DELETE `/api/v1/jobs/{id}` - Delete job with impact analysis

**Priority Queue Integration:**
- Priority levels: 0-4 (normal), 5-7 (high), 8-10 (critical)
- High priority jobs (>=5) processed before normal jobs
- "Run Now" sets priority to 10 for immediate execution

### Component Architecture [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**Component Structure:**
```
components/
├── jobs/
│   ├── JobActionButtons.tsx    - Action buttons for each job
│   ├── JobArticlesModal.tsx    - Article viewing modal
│   ├── JobEditModal.tsx        - Job configuration editing
│   └── JobsList.tsx           - Enhanced job listing (existing)
├── articles/
│   ├── ArticleList.tsx         - Article listing component
│   ├── ArticleExport.tsx       - Export functionality
│   ├── ArticlePreview.tsx      - Article content preview
│   └── ArticleCard.tsx         - Individual article display
```

**State Management Pattern:**
- Use React Context for jobs and articles state
- Implement optimistic updates for priority changes
- Add real-time updates for job status monitoring
- Include error boundaries for component isolation

### File Locations [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Backend Files:**
- `src/api/routes/jobs.py` - Enhanced job management routes
- `src/api/routes/articles.py` - New article API routes
- `src/api/schemas/job.py` - Job request/response schemas
- `src/api/schemas/article.py` - Article schemas
- `src/database/repositories/job_repo.py` - Enhanced job repository
- `src/database/repositories/article_repo.py` - Article repository

**Frontend Files:**
- `src/components/jobs/JobActionButtons.tsx` - Job action buttons
- `src/components/jobs/JobArticlesModal.tsx` - Article viewing modal
- `src/components/jobs/JobEditModal.tsx` - Job editing modal
- `src/components/articles/ArticleList.tsx` - Article listing
- `src/components/articles/ArticleExport.tsx` - Export functionality
- `src/services/ArticlesService.ts` - Article API client
- `src/types/job.ts` - Enhanced job type definitions
- `src/types/article.ts` - Article type definitions

### Technical Constraints [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules:**
- All API calls must use service layer with correlation ID tracking
- Use atomic database operations for job priority changes
- All exports must support UTF-8 encoding for Vietnamese characters
- Never mutate state directly - use proper React Context patterns
- Always validate JWT tokens and user permissions for protected routes

**Error Handling Standards:**
- Implement standardized error response format with correlation IDs
- Use specific exception classes: JobNotFoundException, JobAlreadyRunningException
- Include comprehensive logging with structured logging (structlog)
- Provide user-friendly error messages in frontend

**Performance Requirements:**
- Article listing must load within 2 seconds for 1000+ articles
- Use pagination and virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Implement debounced search with 300ms delay
- Real-time job status updates every 30 seconds maximum

### Database Schema Extensions [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**Required Indexes:**
```sql
-- Job priority queue optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_crawl_jobs_priority_queue
ON crawl_jobs(priority DESC, created_at ASC)
WHERE status = 'pending';

-- Article-job association lookup
CREATE INDEX idx_articles_job_lookup
ON articles(crawl_job_id, created_at DESC)
WHERE crawl_job_id IS NOT NULL;
```

**Queue Position Function:**
```sql
-- Function for calculating job queue position
CREATE FUNCTION get_job_queue_position(target_job_id UUID)
RETURNS INTEGER
-- Implementation calculates position based on priority and creation time
```

### Celery Integration [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**Priority Queue Configuration:**
- Use 'priority' queue for high-priority jobs (>=5)
- Configure task_queue_max_priority=10 for priority levels
- Implement worker_prefetch_multiplier=1 for proper priority handling
- Set task_inherit_parent_priority=True for consistent behavior

**Task Priority Updates:**
- Revoke existing pending tasks when priority changes
- Create new high-priority tasks for "Run Now" functionality
- Use update_job_priority_task for queue reordering
- Include correlation_id for distributed tracing

## Testing

- Test error recovery and rollback scenarios

**Export Testing Requirements:**
- Verify UTF-8 encoding for Vietnamese characters in all formats
