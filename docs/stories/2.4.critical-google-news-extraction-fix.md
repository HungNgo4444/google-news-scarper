# User Story 2.4: Critical Google News Extraction Fix

## Story Overview
**As a** system administrator
**I want** to fix the current 0% article extraction success rate from Google News
**So that** the system can immediately start collecting financial news data with reasonable success rate

## Problem Statement

## Technical Requirements

### Code Changes Required

1. **Modify `src/core/crawler/extractor.py`**
   ```python
   async def extract_article_metadata(self, url: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
       # Add Google News detection
       if 'news.google.com' in url:
           return await self._extract_google_news_with_playwright(url)
       return await self._extract_with_retry(url, correlation_id)

   async def extract_articles_batch(self, urls: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
       # Check if any URLs are Google News
       google_news_urls = [url for url in urls if 'news.google.com' in url]
       if google_news_urls:
           return await self._extract_google_news_batch(google_news_urls)
       # Standard batch processing for other URLs
   ```

2. **Add Single Browser Multi-Tab Handler**
   ```python
   async def _extract_google_news_batch(self, urls: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
       # Process in batches of 10 URLs
       batch_size = 10
       all_results = []

       for i in range(0, len(urls), batch_size):
           batch = urls[i:i+batch_size]
           batch_results = await self._process_batch_with_single_browser(batch)
           all_results.extend(batch_results)

           # Anti-detection delay between batches
           if i + batch_size < len(urls):
               await asyncio.sleep(random.randint(5, 10))

       return all_results
   ```

### Based on `financial_news_extractor.py` Proven Methods

#### Copy Single Browser Multi-Tab Pattern (lines 317-412):
```python
async def _process_batch_with_single_browser(self, urls_batch: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch(
            headless=True,
            args=['--no-sandbox', '--disable-dev-shm-usage', '--disable-gpu']
        )

        results = []

        # Process each URL in separate tab (max 10)
        for i, url in enumerate(urls_batch[:10]):
            try:
                page = browser.new_page()

                # Ultra-fast settings (lines 337-340)
                page.route("**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg,gif,svg,css,woff,woff2,ttf,eot,ico}",
                          lambda route: route.abort())
                page.set_extra_http_headers({
                    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36'
                })

                # Navigate with Google News specific timing (lines 345-358)
                page.goto(url, wait_until='domcontentloaded', timeout=30000)
                time.sleep(4)  # Critical for Google News redirect
                final_url = page.url

                # Handle no redirect case
                if final_url == url or 'news.google.com' in final_url:
                    page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle', timeout=15000)
                    time.sleep(5)
                    final_url = page.url

                # Extract content if successfully redirected
                if final_url != url and 'news.google.com' not in final_url:
                    # Use newspaper4k extraction (lines 364-383)
                    result = await self._extract_with_newspaper(final_url)
                    results.append(result)

                page.close()

                # Anti-detection delay between tabs
                if i < len(urls_batch) - 1:
                    await asyncio.sleep(random.randint(1, 3))

            except Exception as e:
                # Log error but continue with other tabs
                results.append({"success": False, "error": str(e), "url": url})

        browser.close()
        return results
```

#### Key Anti-Detection Features:
1. **1 Browser, 10 Tabs Max** - Mimics normal user behavior
2. **Random Delays**: 1-3s between tabs, 5-10s between batches
3. **Realistic Headers**: Windows Chrome User-Agent
4. **Resource Blocking**: Images/CSS blocked for speed
5. **Proper Cleanup**: Close tabs and browser properly

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Emergency Fix (Day 1)
- Google News URL detection in batch processing
- Single browser with 10-tab strategy
- Basic anti-detection delays

### Phase 2: Stability (Day 2)

## Success Metrics
- **Target**: Achieve 40-60% extraction success rate (vs current 0%)
- **Throughput**: Process 10 URLs per browser session efficiently
- **Anti-Detection**: No blocking from Google News during normal usage
- **Performance**: Complete batch of 10 URLs within 2-3 minutes

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Google News Blocking**:

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation successfully addresses the critical 0% Google News extraction success rate through strategic integration with proven `sync_engine.py` methods rather than creating new untested code.

### CRITICAL THREADING ARCHITECTURE ENHANCEMENT

**✅ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: ASYNC PLAYWRIGHT IMPLEMENTATION**

The developer has successfully completed a **critical architectural enhancement** that eliminates greenlet threading conflicts and enables robust article extraction in Docker environments.

### Technical Achievement Summary

**Core Problem Solved**: Greenlet threading conflicts (`greenlet.error: cannot switch to a different thread (which happens to have exited)`) were preventing Playwright browser automation from working correctly in the Celery worker environment.

**Solution Implemented**: Complete conversion from **sync Playwright to async Playwright** throughout the entire crawling system, with proper asyncio integration.

### Architectural Changes Validated

**✅ File: `src/core/crawler/sync_engine.py` - COMPREHENSIVE ASYNC REFACTORING**

1. **Import Architecture**:
   - **Before**: `from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright`
   - **After**: `from playwright.async_api import async_playwright, asyncio`

2. **Method Signature Evolution**:
   - `_resolve_batch_with_single_browser()` → Uses `asyncio.run(_resolve_batch_async())`
   - `_resolve_with_playwright()` → Uses `asyncio.run(_resolve_with_playwright_async())`
   - `_resolve_with_playwright_enhanced()` → Uses `asyncio.run(_resolve_with_playwright_enhanced_async())`
   - `_monitor_tabs_with_event_detection()` → `_monitor_tabs_with_event_detection_async()`
   - `_monitor_single_tab_adaptive()` → `_monitor_single_tab_adaptive_async()`

3. **Async Integration Points**:
   - ✅ All browser launches: `browser = await p.chromium.launch()`
   - ✅ All page operations: `page = await browser.new_page()`
   - ✅ All navigation: `await page.goto()`
   - ✅ All state waiting: `await page.wait_for_load_state()`
   - ✅ All sleep operations: `await asyncio.sleep()`
   - ✅ All cleanup: `await page.close()`, `await browser.close()`

4. **Concurrency Model Enhancement**:
   - **Before**: `ThreadPoolExecutor` with sync methods
   - **After**: `asyncio.create_task()` with async task management
   - **Result**: Eliminates greenlet conflicts while maintaining parallelism

### Docker Deployment Verification

**✅ Configuration Optimized**:
- Worker pool: `--pool=threads --concurrency=1` (optimal for async operations)
- Environment: `GEVENT_SUPPORT=True`, `EVENTLET_NOPATCH=yes`
- Browser path: `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/home/worker/.cache/ms-playwright`

**✅ Runtime Validation**:
- No greenlet errors observed in worker logs
