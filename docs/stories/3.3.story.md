## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 3.2 (Error Handling & Retry Logic):

- Comprehensive error handling system implemented with circuit breaker patterns
- Celery-based task management with sophisticated retry logic and exponential backoff
- Alert system with multi-channel notifications (email, webhook, log)
- All application components are container-ready with proper async patterns
- Structured logging with correlation IDs implemented throughout the system
- Health monitoring endpoints available for container health checks

### Data Models

**Source: [architecture/docker-deployment.md] & [architecture/deployment.md]**

**Container Service Architecture:**

```yaml
services:
  migration:      # Database migration service (runs once)
  web:           # FastAPI application (port 8000)
  worker:        # Celery workers (horizontal scaling)
  beat:          # Celery Beat scheduler (single instance)
  postgres:      # PostgreSQL database (port 5432)
  redis:         # Redis broker/cache (port 6379)
```

**Volume Management Strategy:**

- **postgres_data**: Database persistence with bind mount to `./data/postgres`
- **redis_data**: Redis persistence with bind mount to `./data/redis`
- **beat_data**: Celery Beat schedule persistence with bind mount to `./data/beat`
- **logs**: Centralized logging with bind mount to `./logs`

**Health Check Configuration:**

- **Startup Period**: 40s for application initialization
- **Check Interval**: 30s for regular health monitoring
- **Timeout**: 10s per health check request
- **Retries**: 3 consecutive failures before marking unhealthy

### API Specifications

**Source: [architecture/rest-api-spec.md] & [architecture/backend-architecture.md]**

**Container Entry Points:**

- **Web Service**: `uvicorn src.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
- **Worker Service**: `celery -A src.core.scheduler.celery_app worker --loglevel=info --concurrency=4`
- **Beat Service**: `celery -A src.core.scheduler.celery_app beat --loglevel=info`
- **Migration Service**: `alembic upgrade head` (run-once service)

**FastAPI Main Application Requirements (Task 0 - MISSING FILE):**

```python
# src/api/main.py - Must create before Docker build
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app = FastAPI(title="Google News Scraper API", version="1.0.0")

# Health check endpoint required for Docker health checks
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "service": "google-news-scraper"}

# CORS configuration for development
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

**Health Check Endpoints:**

- **FastAPI Health**: `GET /health` - Application and database connectivity
- **Celery Worker Health**: `celery inspect ping` - Worker availability
- **Database Health**: `pg_isready -U postgres` - PostgreSQL readiness
- **Redis Health**: `redis-cli ping` - Redis connectivity

**Container Environment Variables:**

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:password@postgres:5432/google_news
DATABASE_POOL_SIZE=20
DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW=30

# Celery Configuration  
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://redis:6379/0
CELERY_WORKER_PREFETCH_MULTIPLIER=1

# Application Configuration
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=8000
ENVIRONMENT=production
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

**Multi-Stage Dockerfile Structure:**

```dockerfile

# Base image with common dependencies

FROM base as dependencies  
# Install and cache Python dependencies

  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1
```

### Technical Constraints

**Source: [architecture/tech-stack.md] & [architecture/docker-deployment.md]**

**Container Technology Requirements:**

- **Docker**: Version 24+ for development environment containerization
- **Docker Compose**: Version 2.21+ for multi-container orchestration
- **Base Images**: Python 3.11-slim, PostgreSQL 15-alpine, Redis 7-alpine, Nginx alpine
- **Process Manager**: Supervisor 4.2+ for production process management

**Resource Limits and Scaling:**

```yaml
# Production Resource Constraints
web:
  deploy:
    resources:
      limits:
        cpus: '1.0'
        memory: 512M
      reservations:
        cpus: '0.5'
        memory: 256M

worker:
  deploy:
    resources:
      limits:
        cpus: '2.0'  
        memory: 1G
      reservations:
        cpus: '0.5'
        memory: 512M
    replicas: 2  # Horizontal scaling

beat:
  deploy:
    resources:
      limits:
        cpus: '0.5'
        memory: 256M
    replicas: 1  # Single instance only
```

**Security Requirements:**

- **Non-root Execution**: All application containers run as non-root user
- **Secrets Management**: Use Docker secrets instead of environment variables for credentials
- **Network Isolation**: Internal network for service communication, external access only through Nginx
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Where possible for security hardening

**Performance Optimization:**

```yaml
# Database Optimization
postgres:
  command: |
    postgres -c max_connections=100
             -c shared_buffers=256MB
             -c effective_cache_size=1GB
             -c work_mem=4MB

# Redis Optimization  
redis:
  command: |
    redis-server --maxmemory 512mb
                 --maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
                 --save 900 1
                 --appendonly yes
```

### Testing Requirements

**Source: [architecture/testing-strategy.md] & [architecture/development-workflow.md]**

**Docker Test Environment Setup:**

- **Test Database**: Separate PostgreSQL container for testing isolation
- **Test Redis**: Isolated Redis instance for test job queues
- **Container Health Dependencies**: Services must be healthy before tests run
- **Clean Environment**: Each test run uses fresh container state

**Test Execution Commands:**

```bash
# Run all tests in Docker containers
docker-compose exec app pytest

# Run with coverage reporting in containers
docker-compose exec app pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test types in Docker
docker-compose exec app pytest tests/unit/ -v
docker-compose exec app pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Test database operations
docker-compose exec app alembic upgrade head
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d news_scraper
```

**Container-Specific Tests:**

- **Health Check Validation**: Test all service health endpoints respond correctly
- **Service Dependency Testing**: Verify proper startup ordering and dependency resolution
- **Volume Persistence Testing**: Confirm data persists across container restarts
- **Environment Configuration Testing**: Validate environment variable loading and precedence
- **Resource Limit Testing**: Ensure containers respect CPU and memory constraints
