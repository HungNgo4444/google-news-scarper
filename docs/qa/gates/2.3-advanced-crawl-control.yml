# Quality Gate: Story 2.3 - Advanced Crawl Control Features
schema: 1
story: "2.3"
story_title: "Advanced Crawl Control Features"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation functionally complete with critical blocking issue FIXED during QA review. However, zero tests exist despite story requirements. Code quality good but test gap creates risk."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Defense-in-depth validation implemented correctly (frontend/backend/database). Missing DoS prevention for date ranges. No SQL injection risks detected."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "FIXED: Celery worker blocking issue resolved. Daily sliding window may cause performance issues for large date ranges without the recommended 90-day limit validator (recommend future enhancement)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "FIXED: Rate limit detection with proper exception handling and job_metadata tracking. No automated tests but logic verified during review."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code well-organized, properly documented with docstrings, follows project coding standards. Enhanced period support (h/d/m/w/y) beyond requirements is good."
